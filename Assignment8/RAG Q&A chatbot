Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot – Documentation
✅ Objective
To build a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that:

Retrieves relevant information from provided documents.

Generates answers using a local language model.

Reduces hallucination by grounding answers in retrieved documents.

✅ Environment Setup
Python 3.11

Virtual environment: rag_env

Key libraries:

langchain

langchain-community

langchain-huggingface

sentence-transformers

faiss-cpu

transformers

torch

✅ Workflow
1️⃣ Document Loading

Load text documents from a local docs/ folder using DirectoryLoader.

Split into manageable chunks using CharacterTextSplitter.

2️⃣ Embedding Generation

Use HuggingFaceEmbeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to convert document chunks into vector embeddings.

3️⃣ Vector Store Creation (FAISS)

Store embeddings in FAISS for fast similarity-based retrieval.

4️⃣ Retriever Setup

Use vectorstore.as_retriever() to fetch relevant chunks for a user query.

5️⃣ Local LLM Integration

Use HuggingFacePipeline with a local LLM (e.g., gpt2, flan-t5-base) to generate answers from retrieved context.

6️⃣ QA Chain

Connect retriever and LLM using RetrievalQA chain:

Retrieves relevant context.

Generates an answer grounded in context.

7️⃣ User Interaction

Accept user queries in a loop until "exit" is entered.

Return generated answers for each query.

✅ Key Features Demonstrated
✅ Successfully loads and processes documents.
✅ Retrieves relevant chunks for user queries.
✅ Generates context-based answers.
✅ Uses local models to avoid API costs, demonstrating an offline RAG pipeline.

✅ Limitations
Answers may be partial due to small local LLM constraints.

Outputs may include additional context; filtering may be required for production systems.

For advanced deployment, larger local LLMs or API-based models can improve answer quality.

✅ Conclusion
This RAG chatbot assignment demonstrates the core principles of retrieval-augmented generation using LangChain, Hugging Face embeddings, FAISS, and local LLMs for offline, cost-free retrieval-based QA workflows, aligned with practical LLM grounding techniques.

If you want, I can also prepare:
✅ A clean rag_chatbot.py final code for submission.
✅ A PowerPoint slide summarizing your assignment for viva/mentor check.
✅ Or a GitHub README for structured submission.
