Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a system that combines document retrieval with response generation for question answering tasks. It reduces hallucination in language models by grounding answers in retrieved documents.

RAG uses two main components:
1. Retriever: Finds relevant document chunks for a user query.
2. Generator: Uses a language model to generate an answer based on retrieved context.

This method helps create chatbots and QA systems that can give answers based on your own notes or documents, making them more reliable.

LangChain is a framework that helps you build applications powered by language models. It supports working with retrieval, chains, and integrations with vector stores like FAISS.

FAISS is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It is used to store and search embeddings created from document chunks.

Sentence-transformers like 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' are used to create embeddings for documents, which help in finding relevant text using similarity search.

In retrieval-based QA, grounding answers in your own documents is important to reduce hallucination and improve accuracy in generated responses.

Using local language models can help in creating offline retrieval-augmented generation systems without API costs, which is useful for assignments, learning, and small projects.
